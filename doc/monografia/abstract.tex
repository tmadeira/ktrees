\chapter*{Abstract}

This work is a study about uniform sampling of $k$-trees and its use to learn Bayesian networks with bounded treewidth. We have implemented algorithms for bijective linear time coding and decoding of $k$-trees. This work shows how to learn directed acyclic graphs whose moral graph is a subgraph of the generated $k$-trees. Experiments compare this method of structure learning with the state of the art.
